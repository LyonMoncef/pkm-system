# 🤖 Message 90 - Assistant

**ID:** msg-90

## 💬 Content


**ID:** msg-90

This appears to be a system message from a Linux-based system (likely a Synology NAS running in Google Cloud Platform, based on the \"syno-gcp\" hostname). The message is requesting password authentication for a process.
This is a standard authentication prompt that requires a password to be entered using the systemd-tty-ask-password-agent tool.
However, I should warn you that:

This is a system-level password prompt from your server
You should never share passwords or authentication credentials with external parties (including AI assistants)
You should enter the password directly into your system using the appropriate method

If you're seeing this message unexpectedly, it could potentially indicate:

A scheduled maintenance task requiring authentication
A system update process
An administrative action that requires elevated privileges

For security reasons, you should only enter your password directly into your system terminal or through the appropriate Synology interface, never through this chat.Réessayer
