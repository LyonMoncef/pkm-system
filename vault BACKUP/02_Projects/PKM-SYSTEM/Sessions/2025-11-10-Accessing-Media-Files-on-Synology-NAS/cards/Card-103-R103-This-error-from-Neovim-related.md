**ID:** msg-103

This is an error from Neovim related to the none-ls.nvim plugin (previously known as null-ls). The error occurs during the CursorHoldI event (when the cursor is stationary in insert mode).
The specific error:
attempt to index field '_request_name_to_capability' (a nil value)
This suggests there's an issue with the LSP (Language Server Protocol) implementation in the none-ls.nvim plugin. The plugin is trying to access a field that doesn't exist, causing the error.
This could be happening because:

You might be using incompatible versions of none-ls.nvim and Neovim
There could be a bug in the none-ls.nvim plugin
Your configuration might be missing something required by none-ls

To resolve this issue, you could try:

Updating none-ls.nvim to the latest version
Checking the none-ls.nvim GitHub repository for known issues
Ensuring your configuration properly initializes the plugin
If you recently updated Neovim, check if none-ls needs configuration changes

The error is happening in the LSP client code that handles capability checks, which suggests it might be related to how none-ls is registering its capabilities with Neovim's LSP system.
